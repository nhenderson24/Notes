jJflash for Ubuntu:

There is no GUI. Time to rip off that bandaid...

To flash some stuff
1. Navigate to the /usr/bin directory
2. enter the command <JLinkExe> to start the program

Once opened:
1. <connect> connects to the emulator
2. Choose the target to connect to (this can be found in the schematic
3. Choose <S> for SWD
4. Choose 4000Khz for speed, or faster if needed
5. Use command <loadfile> followed by the path to the file to be loaded. 
   the path starts at Root.
