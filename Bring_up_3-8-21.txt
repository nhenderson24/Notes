Toolchain.cmake - A list of the tools cmake needs
	Used for cross compliling - a way of telling Cmake what it's building for.
	If not toolchain is not used, cmake will compile for the computer's native environment!

 
Once the toolchain file is comlete
From the command line, during the build configure step, the path to the toolchain file must be provided.
If not provided, cmake will build for the native machine.
 
 
 
cmake supports 4 different build types:
 - debug
 - release
 - Minimum size release
 - a release with debug info
 
 
 ninja - builds the project
 
 
 Homework:
 Copy the toolchain file into el project
 generate the HAL using STM cubed
 
configure IOs as PWMs
Configure PWM Timers
100Hz - 2kHz
Setup FREERTOS in STMCubed


Changing duty cycles changes brightness

Simplest path, scan swithes in a loop
2nd step process buttons on interrupt

LEARN WHAT STACK IS!!!
FreeRTOS.org has literature
