Cmake! Notes on the most powerfully convoluted thing in the history of ever
(Linux version)

cmake is a system and compiler agnostic way to configure and build complex project.
Once setup, cmake will automate the build process and spit out builds. 
The b!tch is the setup part.

Install:
 - How to cmake good video tutorial on cmake seems out of date / no worky
   instead try the following command from terminal:
   sudo apt install cmake # version <version>
   NOTE: Typing "cmake" into terminal will give useful hints for installing!

Fundamentals:
 - In Cmake projects have a source directory and a binary directory.

 - Source Directory:
   All files needed for the build live here including CMakeLists.txt
   The source directory is version controlled using git, subversion or whatever.   In BAF projects this is the project root directory

- Binary Directory:
  Where everything produced by the build proccess is created
  This includes libraries, executables, test output, etc...
  BAF (and most other devs) refer to this as the build directory
  CMakeCache.txt is added in this directory and stores info for future builds
  Nothing generated by Cmake or in the build directory should be version control  led. Break out the gitignore.txt!
 
Files meant for Human interaction:

 - CMakeLists.txt
   Human readable, defines what should be build and how. The file is platform indepentent and a description of the entire project.
CMakeLists.txt is the canonical description of the project! 
THIS FILE CONTROLS everything CMake will do in setting up and performing the build!
