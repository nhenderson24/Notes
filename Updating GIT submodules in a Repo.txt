Git Submodules





Updating DCP to a specific MCP branch:

- nav into the DCP REPO at the correct branch
- cd into BasVfdFirmware dir
-> git fetch origin (gets new submodule info, BUT DOES NOT switch to that submodule branch)
-> git checkout <branch> (switches to the selected branch)

- cd back to DCP repo
-> git status (verify the change has been made!)
-> git add <repo name> (updates the main repo's knowledge of the submodule)
-> git commit (will ask for an update, provide in vs code!)
